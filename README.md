# Dharana

A Chrome extension that forces intentionality on distracting websites.



## How it works

1. Visit Reddit, X, or YouTube
2. Before seeing anything, you're asked: **"What's your purpose?"**
3. Type your intention and you get **5 minutes**
4. When time's up, the tab is **permanently blocked**
5. Want to continue? Open a new tab and state your purpose again

That's it. No settings, no snooze buttons, no workarounds.

## The idea

Every distraction starts with "I'll just check one thing." This extension adds a tiny bit of friction that breaks that autopilot behavior. By forcing you to articulate why you're there, you either:
- Realize you don't have a good reason and close the tab
- Have a clear purpose and use your 5 minutes intentionally

The hard 5-minute limit means you can't "just keep scrolling." The tab dies. If you really need more time, you consciously open a new tab and re-commit to a purpose.
